## Introduction
 This Java program was developed to use move data to clients without server(s) for myself.
The client(s) has/have to connect to the other client or a repeater that broadcasts the other clients and others that is/are connected to them; And repeat, repeat them.
 These ways could be looked like P2P network. ~But, actually, I'm not interested in that.~
